<h1 align="center">Project Nova Supabase CRUD Template</h1>
<h3 align="center">A Supabase-stack Wordpress Alternative in progress</h3>

<p>This is a work-in-progress template that I'll be using with future freelance clients who need a database for their React.js-based website. It will be used as a Wordpress alternative starting in 2024.</p>
<p>It is a bare-bones CSS-less template me and my freelance clients use as a base for websites that require a Wordpress alternative. All basic CRUD functions are coded in and this project will be going through numerous updates. </p>
